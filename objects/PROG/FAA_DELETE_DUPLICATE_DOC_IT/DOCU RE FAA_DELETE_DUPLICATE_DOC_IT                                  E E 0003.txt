AS The program automatically corrects duplicate entries in table           
   <AB>FAAT_DOC_IT</> provided that these entries were created by the      
   depreciation posting run or by the balance carryforward.                
AS Removing the duplicate entries is a prerequisite for the upgrade to     
   release SAP S/4HANA 1909 (i.e. software component version S4CORE 104) or
   higher.                                                                 
AS This program corrects the corresponding issue with the conversion class 
   <AB>CL_XCLA_FAAT_DOC_IT</> during the upgrade to release SAP S/4HANA    
   1909 or higher.

AS The program is available as of source release sFIN 2.0 (i.e. software   
   component version SAP_FIN 720).

AS In the first step, the program selects duplicate entries in table       
   <AB>FAAT_DOC_IT</> at database level.                                   
AS If duplicate entries are found, the program sums up the amount fields of
   the duplicate entries.                                                  
AS In the second step, the program deletes duplicate entries from the      
   database and replaces them with new unique database entries. The sums of
   the selected amount fields are used to fill the amount and currency type
   fields of the so-called currency vector.                                
AS The program checks if all non-key fields, besides the amount fields, are
   filled identically. If this is <ZH>not</> the case, the program issues  
   an error message.                                                       
AS The program algorithm makes sure that the balances at the level of asset
   master data are <ZH>not</> changed. This is important because the       
   program typically processes data in closed fiscal years.
