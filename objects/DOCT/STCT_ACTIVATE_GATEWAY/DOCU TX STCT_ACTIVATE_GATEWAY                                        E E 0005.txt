*  Use this task to activate SAP Gateway. This is equivalent to the        
   execution of transaction                                                
=   <DS:TRAN./IWFND/IWF_ACTIVATE>/IWFND/IWF_ACTIVATE.</>                   
*  After you have performed all customizing steps, the final step is to    
   activate SAP Gateway itself. This activity will start all the SAP       
   Gateway services.                                                       
*  You can also deactivate the SAP Gateway running transaction             
=   <DS:TRAN./IWFND/IWF_ACTIVATE>/IWFND/IWF_ACTIVATE.</>                   
*  All services will stop running, and an error message will be sent to any
   system that calls for the services.
