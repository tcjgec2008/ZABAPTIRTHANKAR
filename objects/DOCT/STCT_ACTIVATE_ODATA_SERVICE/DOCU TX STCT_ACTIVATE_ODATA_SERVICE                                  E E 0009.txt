*  Use this task to select OData services for activation according to      
   transaction

*  The activation of an OData service always processes the steps:          
N1 Create OData service; if the OData service is already available, it will
   not be created again (i.e. it will not change the processing mode,      
   prefix, package assignment)                                             
N1 Assign Alias; if processing mode is not co-deployed only                
N1 Activate ICF node                                                       
*                                                                          
*  The result of each step is also reflected in the detailed log (Status   
   OData service / Status Alias / Status ICF node).

*  The detailed log message 'diff. proc. mod' indicates that the service is
   already available but using a different processing mode than selected.
