*  Use this task to activate the determined OData services according to    
   transaction                                                             
=   <DS:TRAN./IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE>/IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE.</>                 
*  The services will be created with the prefix and in the package that is 
   defined in the task 'Set transport options for to be activated OData    
   Services'.                                                              
*  OData services are activated in processing mode 'Co-deployed only'      
   except for OData service '/IWFND/TASKPROCESSING' which is activated in  
   processing mode 'Routing-based' using the SAP System Alias defined in   
   the UI.                                                                 
*  The activation of an OData service always processes the steps:          
N1 Create OData service; if the OData service is already available, it will
   not be created again (i.e. it will not change processing mode, prefix or
   package assignment)                                                     
N1 Assign SAP System Assign Alias, if processing mode is not 'Co-deployed  
   only'                                                                   
N1 Activate ICF node                                                       
*  The result of each step is reflected in the detailed log (Status OData  
   service / Status ICF node / Status Alias).

*  The task 'Set transport options for to be activated OData Services' must
   be preprocessor of this task.

*  In case of issues try to activate the service manually with transaction 
=   <DS:TRAN./IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE>/IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE.</>                 
*  The detailed log message 'diff. proc. mode' indicates that the service  
   is already available, but not in processing mode 'Co-deployed only'. In 
   case the OData service is activated with the system alias 'LOCAL', no   
   error will be shown, because from functional point of view the          
   configuration is working (log message: diff. proc. mode / Alias 'LOCAL' 
   found)                                                                  
*  After activation errors have been solved, rerun this task list with the 
   same configuration, so that the corresponding roles are created         
   correctly.
