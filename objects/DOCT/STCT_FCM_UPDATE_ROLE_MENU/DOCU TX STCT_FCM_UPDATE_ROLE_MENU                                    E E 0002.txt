   is a necessary manual step and needs to be done in transaction 'Role

=   <DS:TRAN.PFCG>PFCG</> ).                                               
*  The detailed log of the task offers a link to the transaction 'Roles:   
   Mass Generation of Profiles' (

U1 Remark                                                                  
*  By default, when deselecting the task 'Set transport options for to be  
   activated OData Services' (OData ICF Activation mode only), the task    
   will be also deselected assuming the task list is executed in a         
   productive environment. In case an update of the role menu is wanted,   
   you must check the task again.
